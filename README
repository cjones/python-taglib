Requirements:

    Python-2.6
    Python Imaging Library (PIL) if you want image support


Installing:

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install


Example usage:

    from taglib import tagopen, InvalidMedia, ValidationError

    # open metadata read-only
    try:
        tag = tagopen('somefile.mp3')
    except InvalidMedia:
        print 'no decoder found'

    # if you wish to rewrite the tags, open without readonly:
    tag = tagopen('somefile.mp3', readonly=False)

    # you can pass already-open files to tagopen.  if you open the file
    # yourself and intend to write in-place, you must open it as 'r+'
    with open('anotherfile.mp3', 'r+') as fp:
        tag = tagopen(fp, readonly=False)

    # if you know exactly what decoder you will need, it can be
    # faster to use it directly.  these objects are never readonly.
    tag = MP3('somefile.mp3')

    # you can change metadata as a dict or attribute:
    tag.genre = u'Alternative'
    tag['year'] = 1974

    # metadata is validated when set:
    try:
        tag['year'] = -4
    except ValidationError, error:
        # ValidationError: year: out of range of uint16

    # show formatted (default to STDOUT)
    tag.display(stream=sys.stderr)

    # write new mp3 with update metadata
    tag.dump('new.mp3')

    # write in-place.
    tag.name = 'hi'
    tag.save()

    # get whole thing as a string
    mp3 = tag.dumps()

    # change the ID3 version
    tag.save(version=4)

    # show formatted metadata
    tag.display(stream=sys.stdout)

    # if there are unrecognized tags, they go in _unknown
    print tag._unknown

    # if you want to preserve unknown tags when you write:
    tag.save('new.mp3', unknown=True)

    # you can copy metadata from one tag to another:
    src = tagopen('old.m4a')
    dst = tagopen('new.mp3', readonly=False)
    dst.update(src)

    # a tag's repr() shows the set metadata:
    print repr(tag)

    # for images, you can give it a path, open file, or PIL ImageFile:
    tag.image = 'someimage.jpg'
    tag.image = fp
    tag.image = PIL.Image.open(fp)

    # you can nuke metadata by clearing the dictionary:
    tag.clear()
    tag.save('no-metadata.mp3')

    # tagdump script will dump a formatted metadata dispaly:
    $ tagdump /path/to/mp3s/


Notes:

    * Rewriting tags is only supported for MP3 (ID3) formats.

    * Supported formats are M4A (mpeg4), MP3 (id3), FLAC (vorbis),
      OGG (vorbis), and IFF (wav/aiff).

    * You need to install Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image
      support.

    * Metadata objects returned by tagopen() behave like a dictionary
      and implement all related functions.  You may also access the
      metadata fields as attributes.

    * Access to known fields return None if they are not set (you will
      never get an AttributeError or KeyError for these fields)

    * When setting metadata attributes, ValidationError is raised if you
      attempt to set an invalid value.

    * ID3 is not a comprehensive implementation of every available
      field.  It only supports a subset of tags, namely the ones that
      iTunes uses to store metadata.  These tags are:

      album, album artist, artist, bpm, comment, compilation, composer, disk, encoder, gapless, genre, grouping, image, lyrics, name, sort album, sort album artist, sort artist, sort composer, sort name, sort video show, track, video description, video episode, video episode id, video season, video show, volume, year,

      ... anything else is stored in _unknown, provided you opened it with
          readonly=False
