Installing:

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install


Example usage:

    import taglib
    try:
        tag = taglib.tagopen('somefile.mp3')
    except taglib.InvalidMedia:
        print 'no decoder found'
    tag.genre = u'Alternative'
    tag['year'] = 1974
    tag.save('new.mp3')
    tag.dump(stream=sys.stdout)  # shows formatted metadata
    other = taglib.tagopen('hugs.m4a')
    tag.update(other)
    print tag
    tag.image = 'someimage.jpg'  # can set a path, open file, or PIL instance
    tag.clear()
    tag.save('no-metadata.mp3')

    $ tagdump /path/to/mp3s/


Notes:

    * Rewriting tags is only supported for MP3 (ID3) formats.  It saves
      to a new file rather than trying to write in-place.

    * Supported formats are M4A (mpeg4), MP3 (id3), FLAC (vorbis),
      OGG (vorbis), and IFF (wav/aiff).

    * You need to install Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image
      support.

    * Metadata objects returned by tagopen() behave like a dictionary
      and implement all related functions.  You may also access the
      metadata fields as attributes.

    * Access to known fields return None if they are not set (you will
      never get an AttributeError or KeyError for these fields)

    * When setting metadata attributes, ValidationError is raised if you
      attempt to set an invalid value.

    * ID3 is not a comprehensive implementation of every available
      field.  It only supports a subset of tags, namely the ones that
      iTunes uses to store metadata.  These tags are:

      album, album artist, artist, bpm, comment, compilation, composer, disk, encoder, gapless, genre, grouping, image, lyrics, name, sort album, sort album artist, sort artist, sort composer, sort name, sort video show, track, video description, video episode, video episode id, video season, video show, volume, year,
